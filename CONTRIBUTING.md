# Contributing

Contributing is highly encouraged with the goal of making it as easy as possible for people to get started with Vindinium. I have just a few guidelines in doing so:

* If making a fork, please ensure that pull requests include the original package name, e.g. `github.com/geetarista/vindinium-starter-go`.

* Please discuss before making any major changes to the package API and/or the client. I've tried to stay as close as possible to the Python starter but also using idiomatic Go.

* Please don't attempt to add your bot as that defeats the purpose of competing on Vindinium.

* When debugging issues, please use the `-d` (debug) flag to output as much useful information as possible.
